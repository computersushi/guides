First step in any design is to look at the project at hand. Personal project, you should consider the feel, message, representation, and idea of the project. You should pick a typeface that will serve the project service. You should ask yourself if said typeface will impact the message you're trying to deliver. Is it bold enough? Should it be subtle? What impact do I want this piece to have? 
For client work such questions are equally important. 

Consider an ideal typeface to be flexiable to your design needs, for kerning, spaceing, weight, and overall new ideal inspirations. 

Picking a typeface is a diffcult decison to make, but the most fun if you make it. It's like picking a good outfit for the occasion.
